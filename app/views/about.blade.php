        <p>
            Bullnanza Bulldogges has been around for many years. However, we are continually striving to improve and build upon our knowgledge to provide you with the best family dog possible. We are family owned and located in the Texas Hill Country. Our dogges do not live in Kennels. They share our home with my family, a schnauzer and a couple of outdoor cats. These dogs are part of our family and we care very much about them. Whether playing with the kids in the yard, riding to the feed store, or snuggling up on the couch our dogges do it all!

            All Bullnanza Bulldogges are family first. They are well socialized and worked with daily. These dogges are the ultimate family companions!

            Our Olde English Bulldogges are great with Children and have an even temperament. They make an excellent family protector and companion dog. Our dogges are playful, energetic, and obedient dogges. They are healthier, live longer, breathe better, and can withstand hot and cold temperatures better than AKC English Bulldogs.
        </p>

            Our goal at Bullnanza Bulldogges is to produce consistency in health and temperament in every generation we produce. We will do this by breeding only non-related, healthy dogges that meet our criteria of health and quality. Our Bulldogges can breed and whelp their own pups without any help from us, and with less health problems of the modern day AKC English Bulldog.

    <h2 class="canevalee centeredText">About Olde English Bulldogges</h2>
    <p class="centeredText">
        Olde English Bulldogges are NOT the same as the AKC bulldogs. Olde English Bulldogges are for bulldog lovers who wish their bulldogs could do just a little more. The Olde English Bulldogge is a recreation of the bulldogge that originated in England between 1600 and 1700, that was used primarily in the sport of bull-baiting. For this purpose these dogs where built for functionality that contributed to the necessary physical stamina and endurance which allowed them to participate in such sports. 
    </p>
    <p class="centeredText">
        Around 1835, laws were passed in England banning the sport of bull-baiting and, as a result, the Bulldogges main purpose of existence vanished. Within a decade the numbers of Bulldogges declined drastically almost to extinction. Dog show fanciers took an interest in the breed, but they were in pursuit of a more aesthetically pleasing bulldog for the show ring. They crossed the remnants of the existing stock with the pug and over the years that followed they developed the modern day English Bulldog. Unfortunately, the modern day English Bulldog is wrought with genetic health problems. The shortened muzzle and spine combined with overall more compact structure of the English Bulldog contributes to the many health disorders that are prevalent within the modern AKC English Bulldog breed. Please do your research before you buy one.
